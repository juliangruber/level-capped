# level-capped

Capped collections for [LevelDB](https://github.com/rvagg/levelup).

Capping happens offline in order not to slow the main operations down.

## Usage

```js
var cap = require('level-capped');
var levelup = require('levelup');

var db = levelup(__dirname + '/db');

// cap the foo collection to 10 entries
var capped = cap(db, 'foo', 10);

// now insert data and eventually there will max. 10 entries
// in the foo collection
db.put('foo!01', 'bar');

// ...
```

## API

### cap(db[, prefix], max)

Let there never be more than `max` entries (that start with `prefix`).

### cap#end

Stop capping.

## Installation

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do

```bash
$ npm install level-capped
```
